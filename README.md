During the first week of my Full Stack Development (MERN STACK) course at WQsoftwares, I worked on several projects focused on foundational web development skills. These projects were created using HTML and CSS, highlighting my ability to design and structure web pages effectively. Each project is based on daily presentations and tasks assigned by my instructor, allowing me to apply theoretical knowledge in practical scenarios.

Project 1: A basic personal portfolio webpage using HTML for structure and CSS for styling.
Project 2: A responsive navigation bar for a fictional company, showcasing my understanding of layout techniques and CSS styling.
